### Problem 1
for i in range(12):
    balance = balance - (balance*monthlyPaymentRate) + (balance - (balance*monthlyPaymentRate)) * (annualInterestRate/12)
print("Reamining Balance: ", round(balance, 2))

### Problem 2
newBalance = balance
MIR = (annualInterestRate/12)
r = 0

while balance > 0:
    for i in range(12):
        balance = balance - r + (MIR * (balance-r))
    if balance >= 1:
        r += 10
        balance = newBalance
    else:
        break
print("Lowest Payment: ", r)

### Problem 3
MIR = (annualInterestRate/12)
newBalance = balance
lowerBound = newBalance/12
higherBound = (newBalance * (1 + MIR)**12)/12.0
epsilon = 0.03

while abs(balance>epsilon):
    r = (higherBound+lowerBound)/2
    balance = newBalance
    for i in range(12):
        balance = balance - r + ((balance - r) * MIR)
    if balance>epsilon:
        lowerBound = r
    elif balance<-epsilon:
        higherBound = r
    else:
        break
print('Lowest Payment: ', round(r, 2))
